# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

# After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

# 1. Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# 2. Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Alternative: If you prefer to use 'main' as the default branch
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main

# 3. Verify the push was successful
git remote -v

# Note: Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your actual values
